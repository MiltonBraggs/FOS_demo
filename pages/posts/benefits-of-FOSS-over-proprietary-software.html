    <h3>1. FLEXIBILITY AND AGILITY</h3>
    <p class="post-text">IT leaders must fundamentally provide flexibility and agility for their enterprise. If you
        can't compete on agility, you're going to get left behind by the competition. Open source enables technology
        agility, typically offering multiple ways to solve problems. Open source helps keep your IT organization from
        getting blocked because a particular capability isn't available from a vendor. Instead of waiting for the vendor
        to deliver that capability, you can create it yourself.</p>


    <h3>2. SPEED</h3>
    <p class="post-text">Open source enables speed. A great advantage of open source is the ability to take the
        community versions, get started, understand whether they can solve your business problem, and begin to deliver
        value right away. Once you make that determination, professional support and services are increasingly available
        for open source products, especially those supported by Red Hat.
        This allows you to get the best of both worlds â€” flexibility, agility, and the ability to get started quickly
        and inexpensively, with the ability to mature to a large scale, fully supported, enterprise-grade
        implementation, and you dont have to go over proprietary licensing hurdles to get there.
    </p>

    <h3>3. COST-EFFECTIVENESS</h3>
    <p class="post-text">Open source is generally much more cost-effective than a proprietary solution.
        Not only are open source solutions typically much more inexpensive in an enterprise environment for equivalent
        or superior capability, but they also give enterprises the ability to start small and scale (more on that coming
        up).
        Given that enterprises are often budget challenged, it just makes financial sense to explore open source
        solutions.
