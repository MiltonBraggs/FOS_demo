    <p class="post-text">In the 1950s and 1960s, computer operating software and compilers were delivered as a part of hardware purchases without separate fees. At the time, source code, the human-readable form of software, was generally distributed with the software providing the ability to fix bugs or add new functions. Universities were early adopters of computing technology. Many of the modifications developed by universities were openly shared, in keeping with the academic principles of sharing knowledge, and organizations sprung up to facilitate sharing. </p>

    
    <p class="post-text">As large-scale operating systems matured, fewer organizations allowed modifications to the operating software, and eventually such operating systems were closed to modification. However, utilities and other added-function applications are still shared and new organizations have been formed to promote the sharing of software.</p></p>
    
    
    <p class="post-text">In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software.

    <p class="post-text">In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free
        from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an
        annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.Stallman also published the
        GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software.
    </p>

    <p class="post-text">Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between
        Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was
        based on MIT code.Soon after the launch, he used the existing term "free software" and founded the Free Software
        Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.

    <p class="post-text">In 1989, the first version of the GNU General Public License was published. A slightly updated
        version 2 was published in 1991. In 1989, some GNU developers formed the company Cygnus Solutions. The GNU
        project's kernel, later called "GNU Hurd", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by
        1991. Some of these, especially the GNU Compiler Collection, had become market leaders in their own right. The
        GNU Debugger and GNU Emacs were also notable successes.</p>
